  AFFECTS: nvidia-driver users
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  As of writing, a update for the nvidia-driver is needed. The current 
  nvidia-driver beta version 290.1 has support for xorg-server 1.12.  
  Users of the legacy driver are adviced to not use the WITH_NEW_XORG switch.

  AFFECTS: users libglut, dri. 
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The old and unmaintained libglut shipped with MESA was replaced with a new
  implementation called freeglut. Freeglut is already used as the GLUT
  implementation in many Linux distributions. This change requires that all
  ports linking to libGLUT be recompiled since libGLUT and freeglut differ in
  shared library version.

  portmaster -o graphics/freeglut graphics/libglut
  portmaster -r freeglut

  Starting with graphics/dri version 8.0. A number of older dri driver modules
  were dropped. If you using one of the following you should consider not
  using the WITH_NEW_XORG switch.

  i810, mach64, mga, r128, r300, r600, savage, sis, tdfx and unichrome.  

** This needs at least a review **

  AFFECTS: users of mesa based ports (libGL etc) and xorg-server.
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  Update default mesa (libGL and friends) to 7.6.1 and xorg-server to 1.7.7.
  Add a new switch WITH_NEW_XORG, for people that want mesa 7.11.x and
  xorg-server 1.10.4, this will also update xf86-video-intel to the version
  that only supports KMS. If you FreeBSD version doesn't have KMS then you
  shouldn't use the WITH_NEW_XORG macro on machines with intel graphics.
  Supported versions of FreeBSD with KMS kernel support:
  10.0-Current with a patch

  When switching xorg-server versions make sure to rebuild your xf86-* ports.

  Mention acceleration issues with KDE and 1.10.x. Nvidia shouldn't have any
  problems. Ati should work, but acceleration might be botched.
  The nouveau driver is sadly a casualty, it needs to be updated and kernel
  support needs to be written. Other rarer drivers aren't tested.
